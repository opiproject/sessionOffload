This repository has definitions of API's to accellerate network applications by offloading packet processing to a hardware switch.

The first API is for applications like virtual Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems called OpenOffload.

The second API is for applications like VPN Gateways that intend to offload IPSEC and GENEVE tunnel processing to the hardware.

## OpenOffload

For details on the OpenOffload for general TCP and UDP packet processing see the OpenOffload README

## TunnelOffload

For details on the TunnelOffload for IP tunnels see the Tunnel README
